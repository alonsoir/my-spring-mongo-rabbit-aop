A test project with mongo, jpa, rabbit, aop, all mixed with spring, forked from @krams,
i added some things related with Items, a new service, a new repository, jsps, some tests...

The idea is to mix different layers with differents connectors like jpa/mysql or 
some broker message like rabbitmq or a simple connection to mongo db server, 
all everything mixed with spring project.
That layers are,first at all, some aop concerns necessary to store events or loggin aspect,
some controllers using REST style archicture, some services, jpa repositories and mongo itself.
Also domain objects for mongo and jpa access and dto objects between controller layer 
are necessary. 

Pre requisites:

	You are going to need to install and execute rabbitmq, mongo and mysql.
	For mysql, it is only necesary to create eventdb database, the tables will be created at runtime.
	For rabbit, just go to http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html and download, install and execute rabbitmq-server command.
	For mongo, just go to http://www.mongodb.org/downloads, install and execute mongod daemon. 

Installation
	 mvn clean install jetty:run 
in order to compile and execute it on a jetty server.
	
Execution

	go to localhost:8080/events
